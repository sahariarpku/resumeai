## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#673AB7) to represent intelligence and focus.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0), nearly white, for a clean, professional feel.
- Accent color: Electric indigo (#6F42C1), slightly brighter and more saturated than the primary color, for highlighting actionable items.
- Body text: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that lends a modern, neutral, machined feel.
- Headlines: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font with a computerized feel to draw user's attention to important messages.
- Use a consistent set of streamlined icons throughout the interface to visually represent actions, data types and sections (e.g. document icons for resumes, folder icons for JDs, and so on.)
- Design the layout with a clear hierarchy and consistent spacing to aid scannability and overall ease of use; sections of user professional info should be in well-defined areas, and controls to apply AI to a JD should stand out.
